Swag labs Automation Testing using Selenium

Automation testing is an essential practice in modern software development, providing efficiency, reliability, and consistency in verifying the functionality of applications. This abstract presents the automation testing framework for Swag Labs, a web-based shopping application, using Selenium, an open-source automation tool. The primary objectives of this project are to ensure the stability and reliability of Swag Labs, enhance the speed of testing, reduce manual effort, and minimize overall testing costs.

Selenium, renowned for its versatility in browser automation, was chosen due to its compatibility with various browsers and operating systems, robust support for multiple programming languages, and active community support. The testing environment consists of Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, Google Chrome, and Visual Studio Code, with test scripts developed in JavaScript.

The scope of testing encompasses functional and regression testing across all modules of the application. Key functionalities tested include user login, product sorting, cart operations, product detail views, quantity modifications, and the checkout process. Test data comprising usernames, passwords, and user information was meticulously prepared to simulate real-world scenarios.

A systematic approach to test execution was adopted, beginning with the identification of test cases, script development, script execution, result analysis, and defect tracking. Potential risks such as environment-specific issues, data exposure, and changes in web elements were identified, with appropriate mitigation strategies implemented.

In conclusion, the automation testing framework for Swag Labs using Selenium significantly improves the reliability and efficiency of the application testing process. It ensures a high level of quality and performance, ultimately contributing to a better user experience and operational excellence.
